</p>



<p>The Civil War, which began in the 1830's as a cold
war and moved toward the inevitable conflict somewhere
between 1850 and 1860, was one of America's greatest
emotional experiences. When the war finally broke in
1861, beliefs and political ideals had become so firm that
they transcended family ties and bonds of friendship&mdash;brother
was cast against brother. The story of this
supreme test of our Nation, though one of tragedy, is
also one of triumph, for it united a nation that had been
divided for over a quarter century.</p>

<p>Holding a place in history midway between the Revolutionary
War of the 18th century and the First World
War of the 20th, the American Civil War had far-reaching
effects: by the many innovations and developments it
stimulated, it became the forerunner of modern warfare;
by the demands it made on technology and production,
it hastened the industrial revolution in America.
This conflict also provided the ferment from which great
personalities arise. Qualities of true greatness were
revealed in men like William Tecumseh Sherman, the
most brilliant strategist of modern times; Nathan Bedford
Forrest, one of the greatest of natural born leaders;
Robert E. Lee, "one of the supremely gifted men produced
by our Nation"; and Abraham Lincoln, who, like
the other great men of that era, would be minor characters
in our history had they not been called upon in
this time of crisis. And emerging from such trying times
were seven future Presidents of the United States, all
officers of the Union Army.</p>

<p>But the story of this sectional struggle is not only
one of great leaders and events. It is the story of 18,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
men in Gen. Sedgwick's Corps who formed a marching
column that stretched over ten miles of road, and in that
hot month of July 1863, the story of how they marched
steadily for eighteen hours, stopping only once to rest,
until they reached Gettysburg where the crucial battle
was raging. It is the story of more than two hundred
young VMI Cadets, who without hesitation left their classrooms
to fight alongside hardened veterans at the battle
of New Market in 1864. Or it is the story of two brothers
who followed different flags and then met under such
tragic circumstances on the field of battle at Petersburg.</p>

<p>It is also a story of the human toil and machinery
that produced more than four million small arms for the
Union Army and stamped from copper over one billion
percussion caps for these weapons during the four years
of war. Inside the Confederacy, it is the story of experiments
with new weapons&mdash;the submarine, iron-clad
rams, torpedoes, and landmines&mdash;in an attempt to overcome
the North's numerical superiority.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of <i>The Civil War Centennial Handbook</i> to
present this unusual story of the Civil War, a mosaic
composed of fragments from the lesser-known and yet
colorful facts that have survived a century but have been
obscured by the voluminous battle narratives and campaign
studies.</p>

<p>Much of this material, when originally drafted, was
selected by the National Civil War Centennial Commission
for their informative and interesting <i>Facts About
the Civil War</i>. This original material, revised and enlarged,
has grown into <i>The Civil War Centennial Handbook</i>.</p>

<p>The handbook is divided into five basic parts. The
first is a presentation of little-known and unusual facts
about participants, battles and losses, and the cost of
war. The second is a graphic portrayal of both the men
and machines that made the war of the 1860's. The special
selection of photographs for this portion of the story
were made available through the courtesy of the National
Archives and the Library of Congress. Next are reproductions
in color of Union and Confederate uniforms from
the <i>Official Records Atlas</i> and the famous paintings by
H. A. Ogden. The fourth section is a reference table of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
battles and losses listed in chronological order, accompanied
by a map showing the major engagements of the
war. And primarily for the growing number of new Civil
War buffs, there is a roster of Civil War Round Tables,
as well as a recommended list of outstanding books on
the Civil War.</p>

<p>The material presented in The <i>Civil War Centennial
Handbook</i> has been selected from standard sources, the
most outstanding of which are: the <i>Official Records of
the Union and Confederate Armies and Navies</i>, Moore's
<i>Rebellion Record</i>, Cullum's <i>Biographical Register of
West Point Graduates</i>, Phisterer's <i>Statistical Record</i>,
Livermore's <i>Numbers and Losses in the Civil War</i>,
Fox's <i>Regimental Losses</i>, the <i>Dictionary of American
Biography</i>, Dyer's <i>Compendium of the War of the Rebellion</i>,
the <i>Annual Reports of the Secretary of War</i>, and
last but far from least, one of the richest sources of information
available, my fellow members of the District
of Columbia Civil War Round Table.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT LINCOLN, the Commander-In-Chief of the Union
Army, had four brothers-in-law in the Confederate Army, and
three of his sisters-in-law were married to Confederate officers.</p>

<p>JEFFERSON DAVIS, Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate
Army, served the U.S. Army as a colonel during the Mexican War
and held the post of Secretary of War in President Pierce's cabinet.
Previously, as a senior United States Senator, he had been
Chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. Lincoln and
Davis were born in Kentucky, the only state that has ever had two
of its sons serve as President at the same time.</p>

<p>JOHN TYLER, 10th President of the United States, was elected
to the Confederate States Congress in 1862, but died before it convened.
On March 4, 1861, Tyler's granddaughter unfurled the first
flag of the Confederacy when it was raised over the Confederate
Capitol at Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

<p>The Battle of Lynchburg, Virginia, in June 1864 brought together
two future Presidents of the United States&mdash;General RUTHERFORD
B. HAYES and Major WILLIAM McKINLEY, U.S.A.&mdash;and
a former Vice-President&mdash;General JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,
C.S.A. Five other Union generals later rose to the Presidency:
ANDREW JOHNSON, U.S. GRANT, JAMES A. GARFIELD,
CHESTER A. ARTHUR, and BENJAMIN HARRISON.</p>

<p>The four Secretaries of War during the eleven years prior to the
Civil War were all from the South. All four later held office in the
Confederate government.</p>

<p>Fourteen of the 26 Confederate Senators had previously served in
the United States Congress. In the Confederate House of Representatives,
33 members were former U.S. Congressmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Confederate Generals ROBERT E. LEE and P.G.T. BEAUREGARD
both ranked second in their graduating classes at West Point, and
both officers later returned to hold the position of Superintendent
of the Academy. Lee's appointment to the rank of full colonel in
the United States Army was signed by President Lincoln.</p>

<p>In 1859 WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN was appointed the first
president of what is today the Louisiana State University. Although
his chief claim to fame was the destructive "March to the Sea", a
portrait of the Union general occupies a prominent place in the
Memorial Tower of this Southern university.</p>

<p>Over one-fourth of the West Point graduates who fought during the
Civil War were in the Confederate Army. Half of the 304 who
served in Gray were on active duty in the United States Army when
war broke out. Of the total number of West Pointers who went
South, 148 were promoted to the rank of general officer. In all,
313 of the 1,098 officers in the United States Army joined the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>One fourth of the officers in the United States Navy resigned to
cast their lot with the Confederate Navy. Of the 322 who resigned,
243 were line officers.</p>

<p>When J.E.B. STUART raided Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in
1862, he was pursued by Federal cavalry under the command of
his father-in-law, Brig. Gen. PHILIP ST. GEORGE COOKE, whose
name is frequently confused with that of Confederate General
PHILIP ST. GEORGE COCKE, both West Pointers. As if that
weren't bad enough, there was a Union general by the name of
JEFFERSON DAVIS.</p>

<p>WILLIAM T. MAGRUDER (U.S.M.A. 1850) commanded a squadron
of the 1st United States Cavalry at First Manassas and during the
Peninsula Campaign. In August 1862 he was granted leave of
absence, and two months later he switched loyalties to join the
Confederate Army. On July 3, 1863, he fell during the famous
charge at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>The Virginia Military Institute graduated WILLIAM H. GILLESPIE
in the special war class of 1862. While awaiting his appointment
as an officer on "Stonewall" Jackson's staff, he deserted to the
Union Army and became Adjutant of the 14th West Virginia
Cavalry.</p>

<p>If Blue and Gray didn't meet again at Gettysburg during the annual
reunions, they at least met on the banks of the Nile. No less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
50 former Union and Confederate officers held the rank of colonel
or above in the Army of the Khedive during the 1870's. Two ex-Confederate
generals and three former Union officers attained the
rank of general in the Egyptian Army, holding such positions as
Chief of Staff, Chief of Engineers, and Chief Ordnance Officer.</p>

<p>Only three Confederates ever held the rank of general in the United
States Army following the Civil War&mdash;MATTHEW C. BUTLER,
FITZHUGH LEE, and JOE WHEELER. Lee and Wheeler, though
they served as generals in the Confederate Army as well as in the
United States Army during the Spanish American War, both graduated
at the bottom of their West Point classes. When Lee and
Wheeler were promoted to major general in 1901, their commissions
were signed by a former Yankee officer&mdash;President William
McKinley.</p>

<p>General GEORGE PICKETT, a native Virginian, was appointed to
the United States Military Academy from the State of Illinois.
John Todd Stuart obtained the appointment at the request of his
law partner, Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>The senior general in the Confederate Army, SAMUEL COOPER,
hailed from New York. Before the war, he had been Adjutant
General of the United States Army. From 1861 to 1865 he was
the Adjutant and Inspector General of the Confederate Army.</p>

<p>Fort Sumter was surrendered in 1861 by a Kentucky-born Union
officer, Major ROBERT ANDERSON. Confederate General JOHN
C. PEMBERTON, a Pennsylvanian by birth, surrendered Vicksburg
in 1863. There was no collusion in either surrender; both
men were loyal supporters of their respective causes.</p>

<p>The first Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy,
Commodore FRANKLIN BUCHANAN, commanded the C.S.S.
<i>Virginia</i> (<i>Merrimac</i>) in its first engagement. On the first ship to
surrender under the <i>Virginia's</i> guns was Buchanan's brother, an
officer of the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p>Major CLIFTON PRENTISS of the 6th Maryland Infantry (Union)
and his younger brother WILLIAM, of the 2nd Maryland Infantry
(Confederate), were both mortally wounded when their regiments
clashed at Petersburg on April 2, 1865&mdash;just seven days before
hostilities ceased. Both were removed from the battlefield and
after a separation of four years, they were taken to the same
hospital in Washington. Each fought and each died for his cause.

<p>Poet SIDNEY LANIER fought as a private in the 2nd Georgia
Battalion during the Seven Days' Battles near Richmond. In
November 1862 he was captured on a Confederate blockade-runner
and imprisoned at Point Lookout, Maryland. Sixteen years after
the war he died from tuberculosis contracted while in prison.</p>

<p>New England poet ALBERT PIKE commanded the Confederate Department
of Indian Territory. He wrote the stanzas of the popular
Southern version of <i>Dixie</i>, a tune which originated not in the South,
but in New York City during the 1850's.</p>

<p>At the battle of the Monocacy in 1864 Union General LEW
WALLACE, author of <i>Ben-Hur</i>, commanded the force defending
Washington against General Jubal Early's attack. After the war
he served as Governor of New Mexico and Minister to Turkey.</p>

<p>When the Marion Rangers organized in 1861, SAMUEL CLEMENS
(Mark Twain) joined as a lieutenant, but he left this Missouri
Company before it was mustered into Confederate service, having
fired only one hostile shot during the war.</p>

<p>Confederate Private HENRY MORTON STANLEY, of "Doctor
Livingstone, I presume" fame, survived a bloody charge at Shiloh
only to be taken prisoner. Later he joined the Union ranks and
finished the war in Yankee blue.</p>

<p>ANDREW CARNEGIE was a young man in his mid-twenties when
he left his position as superintendent of the Pittsburgh Division,
Pennsylvania Railroad to pitch in with workers rebuilding the rail
line from Annapolis to Washington. Later in 1861 he was given
the position of superintendent of military railways and government
telegraph.</p>

<p>HENRY A. DUPONT, grandson of the DuPont industries founder,
was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for gallantry at
the battle of Cedar Creek in October 1864. Captain DuPont, who
had graduated from West Point at the head of his class in 1861,
went on to serve as United States Senator from Delaware.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>ELIAS HOWE presented each field and staff officer of the 5th
Massachusetts Regiment with a stallion fully equipped for service.
Later, he volunteered as a private, and when the State failed to
pay his unit, he met the regimental payroll with his own money.</p>

<p>At the age of 15 GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE ran away from home
and joined the Union Army. Neither he nor Elias Howe rose to
officer rank, but both are today in the Hall of Fame for their
achievements&mdash;the air brake and the sewing machine.</p>

<p>In 1861 CORNELIUS VANDERBILT presented a high-speed side-wheel
steamer to the United States Navy. At the time, there were
less than 50 ships in active naval service. The cruiser, named
the <i>Vanderbilt</i>, captured three blockade-runners during the war
and in 1865 participated in the bombardment and amphibious
assault on Fort Fisher. The Federal Navy at that time had grown
to a fleet of more than 550 steam-powered ships.</p>

<p>Admiral GEORGE DEWEY, of Manila Bay fame, served as a young
lieutenant under Admiral Farragut during the attack on Port Hudson
in 1863. His ship was the only one lost in the engagement.</p>

<p>Colonel CHRISTOPHER C. ("Kit") CARSON commanded the 1st
New Mexico Volunteers (Union), and campaigned against the
Comanche, Navajo, and Apache Indians during the Civil War. In
1866 he was promoted to brigadier general.</p>

<p>In his mid-teens JESSE JAMES joined the Confederate raiders
led by William Quantrill. The famous "Dead or alive" reward for
Jesse in 1882 was issued by an ex-Confederate officer, Governor
Thomas T. Crittenden of Missouri.</p>

<p>Of the 2.3 million men enlisted in the Union Army, seventy per
cent were under 23 years of age. Approximately 100,000 were 16
and an equal number 15. Three hundred lads were 13 or less, and
the records show that there were 25 no older than 10 years.</p>

<p>The average infantry regiment of 10 companies consisted of 30
line officers and 1300 men. However, by the time a new regiment
reached the battlefield, it would often have less than 800 men
available for combat duty. Sickness and details as cooks, teamsters,
servants, and clerks accounted for the greatly reduced
numbers. Actually, in many of the large battles the regimental
fighting strength averaged no more than 480 men.</p>

<p>In 1864 the basic daily ration for a Union soldier was (in ounces):
20&mdash;beef, 18&mdash;flour, 2.56&mdash;dry beans, 1.6&mdash;green coffee, 2.4&mdash;sugar,
.64&mdash;salt, and smaller amounts of pepper, yeast powder, soap,
candles, and vinegar. While campaigning, soldiers seldom obtained
their full ration and many had to forage for subsistence.</p>

<p>In the Army of Northern Virginia in 1863 the rations available for
every 100 Confederate soldiers over a 30-day period consisted of
1/4 lb. of bacon, 18 oz. of flour, 10 lbs. of rice, and a small amount
of peas and dried fruit&mdash;when they could be obtained. (It is little
wonder that Lee elected to carry the war into Pennsylvania&mdash;if
for no other reason than to obtain food for an undernourished army.)</p>

<p>During the Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1862 "Stonewall" Jackson
marched his force of 16,000 men more than 600 miles in 35 days.
Five major battles were fought and four separate Union armies,
totaling 63,000, were defeated.</p>

<p>In June 1864, the U.S.S. <i>Kearsarge</i> sank the C.S.S. <i>Alabama</i> in a
fierce engagement in the English Channel off Cherbourg, France.
Frenchmen gathered along the beach to witness the hour-long
duel, which inspired a young French artist, Edouard Manet, to
paint the battle scene that now hangs in the Philadelphia Museum
of Art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The Confederate cruiser <i>Shenandoah</i> sailed completely around the
world raiding Union commerce vessels and whalers. The ship and
crew surrendered to British authorities at Liverpool in November
1865, seven months after Lee's surrender at Appomattox.</p>

<p>The greatest naval bombardment during the war was on Christmas
Eve, 1864, at Fort Fisher, North Carolina. Fifty-seven vessels,
with a total of 670 guns, were engaged&mdash;the largest fleet ever
assembled by the U.S. Navy up to that time. The Army, Navy, and
Marines combined in a joint operation to reduce and capture the
fort.</p>

<p>In July, 1862 the first Negro troops of the Civil War were organized
by General David Hunter. Known as the 1st South Carolina Regiment,
they were later designated the 33rd Regiment United States
Colored Troops. Some 186,000 Negro soldiers served in the Union
Army, 4,300 of whom became battle casualties.</p>

<p>At the battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, the line of Confederate
trenches extended a distance of seven miles. The troop density
in these defensive works was 11,000 per mile.</p>

<p>Over 900 guns and mortars bristled from the 68 forts defending
the Nation's Capital during the war. The fortifications, constructed
by the Engineer Corps during the early part of the war,
circled the city on a 37-mile perimeter.</p>

<p>During Sherman's campaign from Chattanooga to Atlanta, the
Union Army of the Tennessee, in a period of four months, constructed
over 300 miles of rifle pits, fired 149,670 artillery
rounds and 22,137,132 rounds of small-arms ammunition.</p>

<p>To fire a Civil War musket, eleven separate motions had to be
made. The regulation in the 1860's specified that a soldier should
fire three aimed shots per minute, allowing 20 seconds per shot
and less than two seconds per motion.</p>

<p>At the battle of Stone's River, Tennessee, in January, 1863, the
Federal infantry in three days exhausted over 2,000,000 rounds of
ammunition, and the artillery fired 20,307 rounds. The total
weight of the projectiles was in excess of 375,000 pounds.</p>

<p>At the Battle of First Bull Run or Manassas, it has been estimated
that between 8,000 and 10,000 bullets were fired for every
man killed and wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The campaign against Petersburg, the longest sustained operation
of the war, began in the summer of 1864 and lasted for 10 months,
until the spring of '65. The fighting covered an area of more
than 170 square miles, with 35 miles of trenches and fortifications
stretching from Richmond to the southwest of Petersburg. During
September, 1864, nearly 175 field and siege guns poured forth a
daily average of 7.8 tons of iron on the Confederate works.</p>

<p>The greatest cavalry battle in the history of the western hemisphere
was fought at Brandy Station, Virginia, on June 9, 1863.
Nearly 20,000 cavalrymen were engaged for more than 12 hours.
At the height of the battle, along Fleetwood Hill, charges and
countercharges were made continuously for almost three hours.</p>

<p>The greatest regimental loss of the entire war was borne by the
1st Maine Heavy Artillery. The unit saw no action until 1864, but
in the short span of less than one year, over half of its 2,202 men
engaged in battle were hit. In the assault on Petersburg in June,
1864, the regiment lost 604 men killed and wounded in less than
20 minutes.</p>

<p>The largest regimental loss in a single battle was suffered by the
26th North Carolina Infantry at Gettysburg. The regiment went
into battle with a little over 800 men, and by the end of the third
day, 708 were dead, wounded, or missing. In one company of 84,
every officer and man was hit.</p>

<p>Of the 46 Confederate regiments that went into the famous charge
at Gettysburg on July 3, 1863, 15 were commanded by General
Pickett. Thirteen of his regiments were led by Virginia Military
Institute graduates; only two of them survived the charge.</p>

<p>The heaviest numerical loss during any single battle was at
Gettysburg, where 40,322 Americans were killed or wounded. On
the Union side 21 per cent of those engaged were killed or wounded,
in the Confederate ranks 30 per cent&mdash;the largest percentage of
Confederates hit in any battle. The largest percentage of Union
soldiers hit in battle was at Port Hudson in May 1863, where 26.7
per cent of those engaged were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>During May and June 1864 the Armies of the Potomac and the
James lost 77,452 men&mdash;a greater number than Lee had in his
entire army.</p>

<p>Union Army hospitals treated over 6 million cases during the
war. There were twice as many deaths from disease as from
hostile bullets. Diarrhea and dysentery alone took the lives of
44,558 Union soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1861-1865 the Quartermaster Corps of the Union Army
made 116,148 burials.</p>

<p>In the 79 National Civil War cemeteries, 54 per cent of the graves
are those of unknown soldiers. The largest Civil War cemetery
is at Vicksburg, where 16,000 soldiers rest; only 3,896 are known.
At the Confederate prison site in Salisbury, North Carolina, where
12,126 Union soldiers are buried, 99 per cent are unknown.</p>

<p>From 1861-1865 it cost the United States Government approximately
2 million dollars a day to prosecute the war; the Second
World War cost more than 113 million dollars a day.</p>

<p>In 1880 the Secretary of the Treasury reported that the Civil War
had cost the Federal Government 6.19 billion dollars. By 1910
the cost of the war, including pensions and other veterans benefits,
had reached 11.5 billion dollars. World War II was three
months shorter than the Civil War, but from 1942-1945 approximately
156 billion dollars was spent on the military establishment.</p>

<p>The total cost of the war to the South has been estimated at 4
billion dollars.</p>

<p>The public debt outstanding for an average population of 33 million
rose from $2.80 to $75 per capita between 1861 and 1865. In
mid-1958 the per capita debt stood at $1,493 for a population of
175.5 million.</p>

<p>In 1958 the government was providing pensions for 3,042 widows
of Union veterans. In June of that year, as a result of special
legislation, 526 widows of Southern soldiers and the two surviving
Confederate veterans became eligible for Federal pensions. The
last Union veteran, Albert Woolson, had died in 1956, leaving the
two Confederates, John Salling and Walter Williams, to draw the
highest Civil War pensions paid by the United States Government.
The last Civil War veteran, Walter Williams, died in December
1959 at the age of 117. Since then, William's claim as a veteran
has been disputed in the newspapers, but sufficient evidence does
not exist to positively prove or disprove his military status.</p>

<p>The pursuit and capture of Jefferson Davis at Irwinville, Georgia,
cost the Federal Government $97,031.62.<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1861-1865 it cost the Federal government, in millions of
dollars:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$727&mdash;to clothe and feed the Army<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">18&mdash;to clothe and feed the Navy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">339&mdash;for transportation of troops and supplies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">127&mdash;for cavalry and artillery horses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">76&mdash;for the purchase of arms</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">8&mdash;to maintain and provide for Confederate prisoners</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Soldiers and sailors of the United States received 1.34 billion
dollars in pay during the war.</p>

<p>In 1861 an infantry private was paid $13 per month&mdash;compared to
a private's pay of $83 today. A Civil War colonel drew $95 per
month and a brigadier general $124. Their counterparts today
are paid a monthly base rate of $592 and $800.</p>

<p>During the 1860's the average cost of a musket was $13 as compared
to $105 for an M1 Garand in World War II.</p>

<h2>CIVIL WAR CENTENNIAL PROCLAMATION<br />
No. 3882</h2>

<h3>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br />
A PROCLAMATION</h3>


<p>The years 1961-1965 will mark the one hundredth anniversary of the American
Civil War.</p>

<p>That war was America's most tragic experience. But like all truly great tragedies,
it carries with it an enduring lesson and a profound inspiration. It was a demonstration of
heroism and sacrifice by men and women of both sides, who valued principle above life itself
and whose devotion to duty is a proud part of our national inheritance.</p>

<p>Both sections of our magnificently reunited country sent into their armies men who
became soldiers as good as any who ever fought under any flag. Military history records
nothing finer than the courage and spirit displayed at such battles as Chickamauga, Antietam,
Kenesaw Mountain and Gettysburg. That America could produce men so valiant and
so enduring is a matter for deep and abiding pride.</p>

<p>The same spirit on the part of the people back home supported those soldiers through
four years of great trial. That a Nation which contained hardly more than 30 million people,
North and South together, could sustain 600,000 deaths without faltering is a lasting testimonial
to something unconquerable in the American spirit. And that a transcending sense
of unity and larger common purpose could, in the end, cause the men and women who had
suffered so greatly to close ranks once the contest ended and to go on together to build a
greater, freer and happier America must be a source of inspiration as long as our country
may last.</p>

<p>By a joint resolution approved on September 7, 1957, the Congress established the
Civil War Centennial Commission to coordinate the nationwide observances of the one hundredth
anniversary of the Civil War. This resolution authorized and requested the President
to issue proclamations inviting the people of the United States to participate in those observances.</p>

<p>NOW THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States
of America, do hereby invite all of the people of our country to take a direct and active part
in the Centennial of the Civil War.</p>

<p>I request all units and agencies of government, Federal, State and local, and their
officials, to encourage, foster and participate in Centennial observances. And I especially
urge our Nation's schools and colleges, its libraries and museums, its churches and religious
bodies, its civic, service and patriotic organizations, its learned and professional
societies, its arts, sciences and industries, and its informational media, to plan and carry
out their own appropriate Centennial observances during the years 1961 to 1965; all to
the end of enriching our knowledge and appreciation of this great chapter in our Nation's
history and of making this memorable period truly a Centennial for all Americans.</p>

<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the
United States of America to be affixed.</p>

<blockquote><p>DONE at the City of Washington this 6th day of December
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.</p></blockquote>

Dwight D. Eisenhower

<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>

<p>William H. Price is a pursuer of the lesser-known, but important, facts about the Civil War; an interest
that is reflected throughout this unique handbook. Living in Northern Virginia, he has been over many square
miles of the battlefields on foot and, often with a surveyor's transit, has plotted key sites and troop positions
left obscure in the records of the armies. He specializes in the smaller, yet significant battles fought
in Virginia&mdash;First Manassas, Cedar Mountain, Brandy Station&mdash;and in the operations of the signals services
and topographical engineers. Modern data-processing techniques were applied to the Civil War for the first
time when he devised a new method of cataloguing the war's battles, skirmishes, and engagements; this compilation,
prepared by International Business Machines Corporation, is being used by the National and State
Commissions in planning the numerous Civil War Centennial events.</p>

<p>Virgil Carrington Jones, biographer of Ranger Mosby and author of "The Civil War at Sea", has best and
most accurately described Mr. Price as "a walking encyclopedia of Civil War lore".</p>

<p>A native of North Carolina, he has served on the staff of the American Military Institute and is a member
of the Civil War Centennial Commission of the District of Columbia.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
